# atom-config
I need to keep my Atom config somewhere, don't I?!
## Featuring:
* Decked out Flex Toolbar (comes with shortcuts to my most used docs depending on the file opened!)
* Ease of color with Color Picker and Pigments
* Eye pleasure thanks to things like Material UI, Minimap, Expos√©, or File Icons
* No light theme
* Hackerman assistance granted by various languages added along with Linter and Build with support for Make, Gradle and Mix
* Various things such as Git Time Machine and Code Peek let you be more productive, Beautify makes your code slightly less shit, and quick access to Stack Overflow is a godsend
* Why am I writing this? It's just a backup of my config
